# **Toxic plant classifier**

This is an end-to-end ML pipeline for image classification of toxic and nontoxic plants. It uses DVC for managing datasets and MLFlow for experiment tracking. Simple models are created using Pytorch. There is a Streamlit dashboard to analyze different models and the best performing model can be selected for inference by uploading a photo.
